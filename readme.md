A recycler view which uses Volley to load images from a URL (in this instance it was a localhost)

The images are loaded and shown along with a checkbox

If any image is clicked then it will be shown in another page

If you check the checkboxes which are below the images and then click the button below, it will show you the images you have chosen

NB: As there are 100s of files in the application, only the code and resource files have been uploaded
